   1. How big are the variance effects (intuition)
   2. How big is the effect of social renting (really zero?)
   3. Look into heterogeneity of social renting
   4. What about spatial dependence of social renting (cannot find a home in
      Utrecht so surrounding areas
   5. Compare years (why 2015?); would 2005 not be better and cleaner (no
      recession)
   6. run model with subgroups (e.g., no large cities) or only higher skilled
   7. Mundlak correction (name in paper)
   8. Household size per municipality?

*** Openblas
    For faster computation on a low-level (for linear algebra) use
    Openblas. Tried, does not work on Mac as Blas is firmly installed
*** cbsodataR
    Wonderful package on R where data from CBS can be retrieved via an API!
    using the package cbsodataR. Tried and works!
*** Cross-validation
    How does cross-validation really works in Bayesian shrinkage models? Compare
    with fixed effects models
*** Distance interaction effects
    Migration over longer distance is different than migration nearby-would this
    be especially so for social renting. If there is much social renting you
    cannot find a house in your own municipality and will go to cities in the
    neighborhood: positive effect. But negative effect for further away!

I focus on housingcorporations with interaction effects between distance and
municipality at the regional level. No clear effects to be found.

The effect of social housing is in between private renting and home-ownershop.
 When household size is taken into acccount, effect of home-ownership becomes
 positive which seems to be a spurious relation. What is the causality here?
** 01-05-2020
Changed datastructure as follows:
 - municipality  -> regions
 - created panel from 2012-2018
 - focusing more on asymmetry
Changed the results more in an intuitive manner. Home-ownership (and social
renting to a lesser extent) have positive impact on out-migration and negative
impact on in-migration. Moreover, largest cities (especially Amsterdam) have
more out than in-migration (descriptive barplot shows this beautifully for
Amsterdam + plus effect is growing over time. Attractive cities become too
succesful and displacement of incumbents?

    Presented yesterday online at ERSA. Comment from Viktor about whether the size
    of regions is accociated with push factor (it sort of is). So points in
    scatterplot are now related to size of the regions. Key-note
    Pierre-Alexandre Balland mentioned the word Exodus. Is that also not what we
    see. An exodus from cities by the incumbent population in search for
    better/suitable/bigger/cheaper housing. Or in other words: the triumph of
    the city is only for a few--most of the population experiences something
    else.

Two observations
- More homeownership less migration still holds but /within/ region, so more
  likely to push residents?
- How does this tie in with increase in tourism, expats, speculation and overall higher housing prices?
